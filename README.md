<b>SQL Code:</b> Ready to execute against databases formatted according to OMOP CDM v5.3 standards.<br>
<b>SPARQL Code</b>: Configured to run against data formatted in FHIR RDF, compliant with FHIR R4 specifications.<br>
<b>Result Example Image</b>: Provides a display of the query result counts obtained from running the queries against the MIMIC III dataset.
